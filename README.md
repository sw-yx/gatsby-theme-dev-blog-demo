# Gatsby Theme Dev Blog Demo

this is a demo of https://github.com/sw-yx/gatsby-theme-dev-blog, a Gatsby Theme made from https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io.

To blog, make a new folder in `src/pages` and blog under `index.md` with photos colocated.

> ⚠️This is a very rough alpha just to test out gatsby themes

Known untested/probable problems:

- anything to do with i18n
- safely handling cases if no pages are detected
- options for customization being passed into the theme vs siteConfig
- including components/shorttags in mdx
- component shadowing custom layouts

Want to do:

- option to include netlify cms
